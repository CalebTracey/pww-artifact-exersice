# pww-artifact-exersice

<br/>

## Demo
Here is a working live demo: https://calebtracey.github.io/pww-artifact-exersice/

<br/>

## Overview
This project was developed 9/24-25/2021 as an exersice in converting a PDF design artifact into an accurate and functional React JS application. Typography, components, and color pallete are all utilized, designed, and implemented in accordance with the provided documentation.

<br/>

## Technologies
Bootstrapped with Create React App. Layout + components are custom CSS elements.

<br/>

<u>Libraries:<u>
* <i>Faker js</i> for random data.
* <i>React-icons</i> for buttons and icons in the "Calendar of Events" section.
* <i>Prop-types<i> for type checking.
  
<br/>

## Functionality
Intended as a quick project focusing on design, the functionality here is limited. Header menus are interactive and buttons are responsive. The "Back to Top" button is also working. 
  
<br/>
  
The main focus of the project was to design a responsive, accessible, and well represented application in a reasonable amount of time, doing so while following best practices to the best of my ability.
  
<br/>

The demo should perform well on all standard platforms (smart phone + tablets + laptop/desktop). As mentioned earlier, most of the time involed with this project was spent on testing responsiveness and making the appropriate adjustments accross various aspect ratios and device emulators in Chrome DevTools.
