# pww-artifact-exersice

<br/>

## Live Demo:  https://calebtracey.github.io/pww-artifact-exersice/

<br/>

## Overview
This project was developed 9/24-26/2021 as an exersice in converting a PDF design artifact into an accurate and functional React JS application. Typography, components, and color pallete were all utilized, designed, and implemented accordingly.

<br/>

The demo is responsive to a variety of screen dimensions (smart phone + tablets + laptop/desktop). Most of the time involed was spent on ensuring responsiveness and flexibility across devices. 

<br/>

If you happen to be interested in my approach to this excercise, [here is a link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12Cj-6C3tSBxHvjkFbpFgXTKyq3QnJFkMB-c2a7qDXOA/edit?usp=sharing
) to a write up describing my thought process and how I spent my time. If you have any suggestions, questions, or constructive criticism, please drop me a line! I would love to hear any feedback.

## Technologies
Bootstrapped with Create React App. Layout + components are custom CSS.

<u>Libraries:<u>
* <i>Faker js</i> for random data.
* <i>React-icons</i> for buttons + icons in the "Calendar of Events" section.
* <i>Prop-types</i> for type checking.
  
<br/>

## Functionality
Intended as a quick project focusing on design, the functionality here is limited. Header menus are interactive and buttons are responsive. The "Back to Top" button is also working. I also added some simple CSS transitions into the information links below the hero image.
